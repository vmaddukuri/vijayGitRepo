"""
Process: Running a program 
Data segment (CPU)
Code Area  (INstruction to execute code)
Stack (manage function variables, calls)
Heap (Dynamic memory allocation)

Threading: An effective way of concurrency, bcoz it defined as light weight process. 
Thread share the code area, data segemnt of parent process
Threading is cost effective and uses lesser CPU power

Threading contains thrad local storage, stack
